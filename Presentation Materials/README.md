## README for Presentation Materials

1. Capstone PDF is a PDF file of the slides that go along with analysis.  In the middle of the slides there is a gray slide that indicates using the demo jupyter notebook.
2. The demo jupyter notebook allows for users to interact with different slices of their data dynamically.  As long as the data is in the same format as the datasets being imported, the visualizations will work.
